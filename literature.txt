\section{Methods of forecasting}
Various methodologies for WSF  have been developed and utilized as shown in the Figure \ref{fig1}. They can be categorized into distinct subgroups based on modelling principles. Hence, WSF models can be divided into four different types: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Physical models
    \item Statistical models
    \item Artificial Intelligence (AI) models
    \item Hybrid models
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Physical models}
Persistence model is a simple standard model widely employed in WSF. It makes the assumption that the wind speed value for the next instance will be the same as the the previous timestep instance \cite{p1}. However, this model tends to exhibit increased error values as the forecasting time horizon extends. The physical method relies on parametrization and utilizes historical meteorological data, including wind speed, wind direction, temperature, pressure, humidity, surface roughness, and obstacles \cite{p2}. NWP is a state of the art model in the physical models \cite{p3}. By assimilating the meteorological data, physical methods establish boundary conditions for mathematical models, allowing for the WSF and other meteorological parameters. WRF is also one of the physical model which widely uses mesoscale numerical weather prediction system \cite{p4}. It is highly versatile, allowing researchers to simulate a wide range of atmospheric phenomena, including wind patterns, precipitation, temperature, and atmospheric dynamics, at high resolution and over various spatial and temporal scales. WRF incorporates advanced numerical techniques and parameterizations to represent atmospheric processes accurately. The main aim of these models is to utilize inputs from NWP systems, which provide detailed meteorological data and perform the WSF. Prediktor, for instance, is a physical model which relies on NWP inputs and employs complex mathematical modeling techniques to simulate wind patterns and predict wind speeds over various time horizons \cite{p5}. Similarly, Previento, LocalPred, and HIRPOM are other examples of physical models that utilize NWP inputs for WSF \cite{p6}. These models may differ in their specific methodologies and parameterizations but share the common approach of simulating atmospheric processes based on physical principles. However, these physical approaches demand a substantial amount of processing power and execution time because of the mathematical models involved. As a result, they are generally more suitable for medium-term and long-term WSF where the trade-off between computational cost and forecast accuracy is acceptable. Table \ref{literature_physical} provides description of proposed physical approaches from the literature.

 \cite{t2} & Novel WSF method based on Gaussian Process & WSF performance improved for short term and long-term intervals. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}}
\end{table}




\subsection{Statistical models}
Statistical forecasting models represent a significant improvement over physical methods in WSF, because of not relying on computations and uses the past time series data. While physical methods rely on parametrization and complex mathematical modeling based on fluid dynamics and meteorology, statistical models leverage historical data to extract patterns and trends in wind speed variations. They encompass various techniques that include AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, and NARX which are widely used in time series analysis. For instance, in \cite{s1,s2}, the authors introduced a PAR for day-ahead WSF, demonstrating its superiority over other comparative models. Similarly, in \cite{s3}, a hybrid approach combining univariate ARIMA and multivariate NARX models was employed for WSF prediction. Another study \cite{s4} proposed an enhanced version of ARIMA, known as f-ARIMA, for day-ahead WSF forecasting. Additionally, Kalman filters were utilized in WSF, as detailed in \cite{s5,s7,s8}, with authors claiming improved performance through their integration. Summary of different statistical models proposed is provided in the Table \ref{literature_statistical}.

Following are the demerits from the literature of statistical models:
\begin{itemize}
    \item However, despite the advantages of statistical models in handling stationary sequences and simple linear relationships, they encounter limitations when working with the highly nonlinear characteristics of the wind speed data. 
    \item Consequently, the predictive accuracy of these models may diminish, particularly when forecasting over extended timeframes or in regions characterized by highly erratic wind patterns. 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{AI models}
AI techniques are gaining popularity for WSF because of their intelligence to handle huge nonlinear data \cite{a1}. This adaptability makes them a top choice for accurate WSF, outperforming statistical models. Within AI, ML and DL models are prominent categories. ML encompasses a range of models, including SVR, DT-based models like RF, GBM, and K-KNN. For example, in \cite{a2} authors employed state space SVR model for the WSF. Similarly, in \cite{a3,a4}, authors used SVR as the predictor by utilizing other supporting modules for the WSF. Similar to the SVR, authors in \cite{a5, a6, a7} utilized other ML models for the WSF. However, there are limitations of these ML models as given below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ML models face limitations in representation capacity and struggle with effectively handling high-dimensional data.
    \item Face challenges when dealing with the highly non-linear wind speed data.
\end{itemize}

As a result, the researchers have turned their focus to DL models for WSF. DL models learn patterns directly from raw data, removing the need for manual feature engineering. Using interconnected layers of neurons, they capture wind dynamics accurately. DL scales well to large datasets and benefits from computational advances, making it ideal for WSF challenges.
ANN, BPNN, ELM are some of the standard neural networks utilized for WSF \cite{a9}. For example, in \cite{a8}, authors utilized ANN for the WSF in mountainous region of India. However, the performance of these models can be limited due to the absence of a memory element. Standard neural network architectures lack the intrinsic capability to retain and utilize information from previous time steps during the prediction process. Consequently, they may encounter challenges in capturing temporal features and long-term features present in wind speed time series data effectively. Hence, RNNs have been developed specifically to address this limitation. RNNs are well suited for processing time sequence data, like wind speed data, since they predict output based on the temporal features of the data.


In addressing data dependencies, RNNs have been extensively utilized, leveraging the cell's hidden states to transfer information across various time steps. In \cite{a10}, authors conducted a comparison of ARIMA with RNN model for WSF. The results indicated that RNN outperformed ARIMA model. However, the inability of base RNNs to capture long-term temporal relationships in sequential data is limited by issues like vanishing and exploding gradients. LSTM and GRU that are advanced forms of the RNN are developed for addressing the issues with the RNN \cite{a11,a12,a13,a14}. Enhanced versions of LSTM, as proposed in \cite{a15}, and GRU models incorporating correlation analysis and hypothesis testing \cite{a16} have further refined WSF techniques. To further improve these models, bidirectional variants of the LSTM and GRU, capable of processing input sequences in both forward and backward orientations, have been proposed to improve prediction accuracy \cite{a17}. Furthermore, 1D CNNs have also proposed as effective models in WSF, leveraging spatial characteristics of the data for feature extraction \cite{a18}. To enhance performance further, RNN models combining spatial and temporal characteristics, such as TCN utilizing causal convolutions to expand receptive fields, have been introduced for time series prediction tasks. TCN address issues with standard convolutional layers, such as limited receptive fields. For example, in \cite{a19}, authors proposed TCN for the wind speed interval prediction. TCNs require more memory and computational power due to long input sequences and dilation mechanisms, while limited kernel sizes in sublayers restrict their receptive field and the temporal context.

However, despite their utility, a notable drawback of RNN variants lies in their limited receptive field, constraining their potential to model long-term relationships and intricate patterns within wind speed data. To address this challenge, researchers have integrated attention layers into their models, allowing for focused attention on critical segments of the input sequence. However, to overcome the limitations associated with RNNs, a more robust solution has emerged in the form of Transformers \cite{a20}. Transformers rely solely on attention mechanisms, bypassing sequential processing limitations. Further research should be conducted to leverage the advantages of these attention based methodologies in the WSF domain.

However, there are some limitations with the DL models such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The implementation of a single prediction model for the WSF is limited by the noise in the input wind speed data.
    \item  DL models may suffer from overfitting when the training data does not adequately represent the variability and complexity of real-world wind speed patterns.
    \item The computational resources required for training and deploying DL models especially RNN based models can be substantial.
    \item The complex architecture and numerous hyperparameters of DL models require careful selection.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Hybrid models}
To address the challenges with the inherent noise present in the input data and the need for the optimal hyperparamter selection, hybrid models have been developed. There are two different categories in hybrid models: 1) Data denoising based models and 2) Parameter optimization based models

\subsubsection{Data denoising based models} 
In the WSF model training, providing adequate input data is necessary for ensuring effective training and enhancing the model's generalization capabilities. However, the noise in the input data can result in suboptimal training for the WSF model. Hence, many research works have been using the hybrid model using one decomposition module. Decomposing the noisy input signals into simpler frequency subseries using various algorithms makes it easier to denoise the data, enhancing the quality of the input for the WSF model.

There are three major steps involved in these type of hybrid models such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[1]  \textbf{Decomposition:} The original signal is broken down into several subseries through a signal decomposition algorithm.
    \item[2]  \textbf{Noise reduction:} The subseries with higher frequencies, which typically contain more noise, are removed. The remaining subseries are then aggregated to form a noiseless signal.
    \item[3] \textbf{Forecasting:} This refined signal is used for WSF.    
\end{itemize}


In this phase, the decomposition technique selection is crucial since it affects the predictions' accuracy and the efficiency of wind speed feature extraction. Various decomposition techniques such as EMD, WT, and VMD have been widely adopted in recent studies. Since wind speed data is non-linear and non-stationary, hybrid models that use data decomposition have demonstrated notable increases in predicting accuracy. This approach not only enhances the precision of the forecasts but also provides a more robust framework for managing the inherent variability of wind speed \cite{hy1, hy2}. The following Table \ref{deco} provides description on various decomposition methods.

 \cite{a25}  & VMD             & VMD is an improved version of EMD that decomposes a data into modes with specific spectral characteristics, offering improved robustness and accuracy over traditional EMD.                                                          \\ \hline                                       
\cite{a13} & EEMD      & EEMD is an improvement to the EMD that addresses mode mixing issues by adding white noise to the data and averaging the decompositions over multiple trials.                                                                             \\ \hline
\cite{a24}   & SSA                & SSA decomposes a time series into components by applying SVD to the trajectory matrix. It separates the signal into trend, oscillatory components, and noise.                                         \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}




Different hybrid models have been developed to improve the WSF performance by combining data decomposition techniques with DL models. For instance, the authors in \cite{a22} utilized EMD for data decomposition. However, these standard methods have their limitations. WT is sensitive to the choice of threshold, which can significantly impact its performance. EMD, on the other hand, suffers from the phenomenon of mode mixing, where different IMFs can become indistinguishable. To address these limitations, improved decomposition techniques such as EWT \cite{a23}, SSA \cite{a24}, VMD \cite{a25}, and EEMD \cite{a26} have been developed. Methods like VMD excel at handling nonlinear, non-stationary signals and extracting local features, but they can struggle with significant noise and be sensitive to outliers. To further improve upon these models, an advanced version known as CEEMDAN has been proposed for data decomposition. Several studies, such as \cite{a27, a28, a29}, have employed CEEMDAN as the decomposition module within various WSF frameworks. CEEMDAN has emerged as a prominent approach due to its robustness in handling non-stationary signals, making it particularly suitable for WSF. Summary of different hybrid decomposition methods is provided in the Table \ref{literature_hybrid}.


Following are the demerits of the hybrid decomposition based models:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Despite its advantages, CEEMDAN also encounters challenges such as mode mixing, frequency aliasing, and residual noise, which can constrain its performance.
    \item Inaccurate decomposition introduces errors and uncertainties into forecasting models.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Parameter optimization based models}

As the neural network forms the core of the WSF framework, careful consideration of initial parameters is crucial. The initialization method of neural network parameters plays a pivotal role in shaping optimization outcomes. Effective parameter initialization can significantly enhance the success rate of model training. Conversely, inadequate initialization schemes not only impede network convergence but can also lead to gradient vanishing or explosion.

Given the complexity of parameters in data decomposition methods and DL forecasting predictors, manual selection or trial-and-error approaches for parameter tuning often fail to yield optimal hyperparameter sets. Hence, there is a pressing need for parameter selection algorithms to automate this process and ensure precise parameter configurations for accurate WSF. Table \ref{optim} provides description of different optimization methods available.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To address this difficulty, several parameter selection models have been developed in the literature, as shown in Table \ref{literature_optim}. The aim is to identify the most suitable parameters by leveraging nature-driven optimization techniques that mimic the behavior and characteristics of natural processes or species.

Following are the demerits of the parameter selection based hybrid methods:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Although these models are accessible, selecting the best optimization strategy remains difficult since it necessitates careful consideration of criteria such as problem complexity and dataset characteristics.
    \item  The identification of a suitable optimization technique presents a significant challenge.
\end{itemize}


\section{Performance evaluation of WSF approaches}
Enhancing renewable energy integration with the grid necessitates dependable and error-free forecasting approaches. Various indicators, such as MAE, RMSE, MSE, and $R^2$ score, are used to evaluate a model's performance. MAE measures the average absolute difference between predicted and observed values, providing a straightforward interpretation of prediction accuracy. Similarly, MSE penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller ones by squaring the differences between predicted and actual values which helps in identifying the discrepancies in the predictions. On the other hand, RMSE calculates the square root of the average squared difference between predicted and observed values. By penalizing large errors more heavily than MAE, RMSE provides insight into the spread of residuals. Despite their differences, both metrics offer valuable insights into the accuracy of predictive models for WSF. Smaller error values indicate better models. 
The coefficient of determination, often denoted as \( R^2 \), is a measure that indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). A higher \( R^2 \) value indicates a better fit of the model to the data..


\begin{equation}
\text{RMSE}  = \sqrt{\frac{1}{m} \sum_{j=1}^{m} (x_j - \hat{x}_j)^2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\text{MSE}  = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{j=1}^{m} (x_j - \hat{x}_j)^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
R^2 \text{ Score} = 1 - \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{m} (x_j - \hat{x}_j)^2}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} (x_j - \bar{x})^2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}

\section{Motivation}
Based on the current literature reviewed, the following key challenges are identified in WSF:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Integrating data decomposition-based models is essential for enhancing the performance of WSF. However, challenges arise with extended variants of ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), such as complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), due to issues like mode mixing, frequency aliasing, and residual noise. These problems lead to inaccurate decomposition of wind speed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), which in turn hampers the capture of true temporal characteristics, ultimately negatively affecting WSF performance
    \item The forecasting of wind speed faces significant challenges due to the complexity involved in selecting appropriate models and feature extraction methods, which directly affect the effectiveness and accuracy of predictions. A notable trend in WSF is the reliance on  recurrent neural network (RNN)-based models, which, despite their popularity, they often fall short in capturing the intricate spatial and temporal dependencies inherent in wind speed patterns. Their limited receptive field, susceptibility to getting trapped in local minima during training, and long training times due to the dynamic nature of wind speed further hinder their effectiveness. These limitations prevent RNNs from fully modeling the complexities of wind speed dynamics, resulting in suboptimal forecasting performance.
    \item  The performance of WSF models declines with longer forecasting time horizons, mainly due to the insufficient understanding and interpretation of wind speed features. Factors such as variability, temporal dependencies, and non-linear patterns become harder to capture accurately over time. This leads to increased uncertainty and reduced forecasting reliability.
    \item Most of the existing literature on WSF focuses on point prediction models. However, wind speed interval predictions, which provide a range of possible wind speed values, offer a more comprehensive assessment of the uncertainty and variability in wind speed forecasts. Exploring and developing interval prediction models can significantly enhance the performance and reliability of WSF, allowing for more accurate and robust predictions.

\end{itemize}


\section{Research objectives}
Based on the challenges identified in the literature, the following research objectives are proposed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To develop and utilize a decomposition method to address the issues such as mode mixing, frequency aliasing, and residual noise, to improve the decomposition accuracy of wind speed data.
    \item To develop a hybrid WSF model that overcomes the limitations of RNN variant models, by addressing their restricted receptive fields, enabling the model to capture broader spatial and temporal dependencies in wind speed data effectively. 
    \item To develop a WSF model that maintains high performance across various time intervals, addressing the challenges of performance degradation with increasing time horizons, while ensuring control over computational complexity.
    \item To develop an interval prediction model for WSF that provide a range of wind speed values, quantifying the uncertainty of forecasts under diverse conditions.
\end{itemize}

\section{Contributions}
Based on the above limitations of the current WSF literature, various hybrid deep learning approaches have been developed for WSF. WSF methods are evaluated using datasets from two distinct wind farm locations: Block Island and the Gulf Coast - tested across four time horizons: 5-min, 15-min, 30-min, and 1-hour intervals.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The improved CEEMDAN (ICEEMDAN) method is proposed for the decomposition of original wind speed data because it reduces the number of trials while overcoming the problems that the CEEMDAN algorithm have such as mode-mixing, frequency aliasing, and residual noise. 
    \item  A hybrid deep learning model is proposed for WSF which uses ICEEMDAN decomposition method for denoising the wind speed data, and transformer (TRA) network for the WSF. As the WSF models have a number of significant problems, including long training times, poor interpretation of complex and dynamic wind speed characteristics, limited receptive field, and being trapped in local minimum, the transformer network is developed for the WSF. It has a parallelized input structure, which enhances the model training, and ability to interpret more asynchronous relationships between dynamic and complex wind data sequences for the WSF. 
    
    \item The novel and hybrid methodology, data decomposition based reformer model is developed for WSF. The ICEEMDAN algorithm is employed to denoise wind speed data. A robust reformer (REF) model has been developed for prediction of wind speed efficiently. The proposed REF model is significantly more memory-efficient and exhibits faster processing times when handling long sequences in the WSF. This efficiency is achieved through the incorporation of locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) and reversible-residual layers.
    
    \item A novel and hybrid two stage methodology named ICEEMDAN-Autoformer is developed for accurate WSF. In the first stage, the ICEEMDAN algorithm is employed for denoising the original wind speed data. The autoformer (AF) model has been proposed as a predictor for WSF in the second stage. The architecture of AF includes an inner operator known as a series decomposition block. This operator enables the gradual aggregation of the long-term trend component from intermediate predictions. A proficient auto correlation (ACE) mechanism has been developed to expedite the identification of interrelationships and consolidation of data at the level of the series. 
    
    \item A novel hybrid ICEEMDAN-ATCN-BiLSTM approach is proposed by integrating the neural network architecture with ICEEMDAN.  Temporal convolutional network with attention mechanism (ATCN) extracts the important and dominating spatial and temporal features from the denoised wind speed. Bidirectional long short-term memor (BiLSTM) model interprets the important features bidirectionally to forecast the high-quality prediction intervals (PIs). The  integration of attention mechanism to the TCN layers enhance the feature extraction.
\end{itemize}
